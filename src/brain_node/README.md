# Overview

This node monitors gripper force and raises a safety stop when the measured force exceeds a configured threshold.

## Behavior
- Subscribes to `/prongs/force_g` (std_msgs/msg/Float32) — gripper force in grams.  
- Compares each reading to a configured threshold (default: 80 g).  
- Publishes `True` on `/safety/stop` (std_msgs/msg/Bool) while the force is above the threshold (ESTOP).  
- Latches internally:
  - On the first crossing above the threshold, logs a warning.
  - Continues publishing `True` while force remains above the threshold.
  - Optionally resets the latch when force drops below a lower band (for example, 80% of the threshold) if configured.
- Does not command actuators or interact with MoveIt; it only raises a safety flag.

## Build instructions

From your ROS 2 workspace:
```
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select brain
source install/setup.bash
```

(Note: use setup.bash, not setup.bas.)

## How to run

Assuming all hardware drivers are running and `/prongs/force_g` is being published:
```
ros2 run brain brain
```

Override the threshold via parameters:
```
ros2 run brain brain --ros-args -p threshold_g:=100.0
```

## Topics

### Subscriptions
| Topic | Type | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `/prongs/force_g` | `std_msgs/msg/Float32` | Force from gripper in grams |

### Publications
| Topic | Type | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `/safety/stop` | `std_msgs/msg/Bool` | `True` when force exceeds threshold (ESTOP) |

If you need the node to reset automatically, check the node parameters for a hysteresis or reset-band option (e.g., a fraction of the threshold) and set it appropriately.
