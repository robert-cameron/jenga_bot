## Project Overview
- **Problem Statement**: What task or customer requirement does your system solve?  
- **Robot Functionality**: Short summary of what the robot does.  
- **Demo Video**: Embed or link to a short video showing one full cycle of operation.  

---

## System Architecture
- **ROS2 Node Diagram**: Include rqt_graph or custom schematic.  
- **Package-Level Architecture**: Show node interactions and topics.  
- **Behavior Tree / State Machine**: Diagram of closed-loop behavior.  
- **Node Descriptions**: Brief explanation of each node’s role.  
- **Custom Interfaces**: List and explain any custom message types.  

---

## Technical Components
